Archive of the DNS root zone
============================

This repository is generated by a cron job which frequently obtains a
zone transfer of the DNS root zone and commits any changes.

The archive dates back to 2014-03-05. There are likely to be gaps
caused by failures in the cron job. (This archive is a low-effort side
project.)

There is also an archived `root.jnl.gz` which is a BIND journal file
that contains incremental updates to the root zone covering serial
numbers between 2005072701 and 2014030300.


summarize git log
-----------------

The `summarize` subdirectory contains some helper scripts for
selecting which parts of the root zone are shown in `git log --patch`.

The `summarize/gitconfig` file can be appended to your `.git/config`
file to get it set up. This must be done manually because the
`textconv` option runs scripts and git won't let a repository auto-run
scripts.

The `summarize/gitattributes` file is an example that can be copied to
`.gitattributes` and edited to choose which records you want to see in
diffs.


related work
------------

This repository is a companion to [@diffroot on Twitter][diffroot],
which uses [nsdiff][] to produce summaries of how the root zone changes.

The scripts for updating this `saveroot` repository live alongside
`diffroot` which is currently not fit for public consumption because
the repository contains secrets.
